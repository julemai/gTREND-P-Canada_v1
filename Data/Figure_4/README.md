## Independent provincial-scale validation data

These are not data produced in this publication but serve as
independent validation datasets.

* IPNI_data.xlsx<br>
  These data "Estimates of Nutrient Uptake and Removal" published by IPNI. The data were previously 
  accessible under http://www.ipni.net/article/IPNI-3296 but at the time of publication the entire 
  IPNI website was down and the authors were not able to verify this link.

* Wang_Paper_data.xlsx<br>
  These data were published by Wang et al. (2022a) [1] and are
  accessible under Wang et al. (2022b) [2].
  
Wang et al. (2022) and IPNI (2014) provide estimates for the Atlantic
provinces (Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova
Scotia, and New Brunswick) only as an aggregated value. Hence
estimates of the TREND-P-Canada dataset have been aggregated to the
sum of those four provinces rather than comparing them
individually. The census years compared to Wang et al. Wang et al.,
2022 estimates range from 1961 to 2016 while the years compared with
IPNI are from 1971 (for Livestock Manure and Crop Removal) and 1966
(for Fertilizer) until 2011 (for all three components compared).
